# Set the GitHub repo URL and branch

# Clone the specific branch
RUN git clone --branch ${BRANCH} ${REPO_URL} .

# Install LFS and pull the large files
RUN git lfs install

# --- STAGE 2: The "Application" ---
# Now we build the actual Python app
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install Python requirements first
